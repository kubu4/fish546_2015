####Summary
Experiments involving the evaluation of changes in gene expression in the Pacific oyster (<em>Crassostrea gigas</em>)
are often terminal in nature. That is, the animals are sacrificed in order to collect the desired tissue
from which gene expression changes will be assessed. This prevents evaluation of gene-level 
responses by individal oysters to experimental conditions. In this experiment, mantle tissue was non-lethally sampled from three individual Crassostrea gigas. After tissue
collection, the oysters were allowed to recover. After recovery, the three oysters were subjectd to an acute heat shock.
The oysters were sacrificed and, gill and mantle tissues were collected. RNA was isolated from the mantle tissue of the
three oysters, both pre- and post-heat shock. The six RNA samples were prepared for high-throughput sequencing 
and sequenced together in a single lane on the HiSeq2500 (100bp, single end reads).

Gene expression changes, in response to the heat shock, were compared between the pre- and post-heat shocked oysters.
The RNA-seq analysis was performed using the Tuxedo suite. The Tuxedo suite was used to align the raw sequencing reads to the published
Crassostrea gigas genome (ENSEMBL 1.24), quantified them and calculated differential gene expression between the two sample
groups.

This analysis will provide a broad insight into individual changes in gene expression in response to thermal stress in 
the Pacific oyster. Additionally, establishing the RNA-seq analysis pipeline will facilitate the fine-grained examination of
changes in gene expression in each individual oyster in response to heat shock.
