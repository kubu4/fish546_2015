####RNA-Seq Data Files
The following files are the raw sequencing reads produced by the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform.  That are compressed with gzip.

* 2M-HS_CCGTCC_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

* 2M_AGTCAA_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

* 4M-HS_GTCCGC_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

* 4M_AGTTCC_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

* 6M-HS_GTGAAA_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

* 6M_ATGTCA_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz

####Genome File
The following file is a FASTA file of the <em>Crassostrea gigas</em> genome, curated and maintained by Ensembl

* Crassostrea_gigas.GCA_000297895.1.24.dna_sm.genome.fa

####Genome Annotation File
The following file is a general transfer format (GTF) file that contains annotation information (e.g. coding regions, intron regions, untranslated regions) about the Ensembl FASTA file.  Like the Ensembl FASTA file, this GTF file is curated and maintained by Ensembl.

* Crassostrea_gigas.GCA_000297895.1.24.gtf
